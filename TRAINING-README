RNNoise is a noise suppression library based on a recurrent neural network.

To compile, just type:
% ./autogen.sh
% ./configure
% make

Optionally:
% make install

While it is meant to be used as a library, a simple command-line tool is
provided as an example. It operates on RAW 16-bit (machine endian) mono
PCM files sampled at 48 kHz. It can be used as:

./examples/rnnoise_demo <number of channels> <maximum attenuation> < input.raw > output.raw

The output is also a 16-bit raw PCM file.

(1) cd src ; ./compile.sh

(2) ./denoise_training signal.raw noise.raw count > training.f32

    (note the matrix size and replace 500000 87 below)

(3) cd training ; ./bin2hdf5.py ../src/training.f32 500000 87 training.h5

(4) ./rnn_train.py

(5) ./dump_rnn.py weights.hdf5 ../src/rnn_data.c ../src/rnn_data.h
